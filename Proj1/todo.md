# Project 1

- Implement Merge Sort (Weikang)
- Python notebook compare timing of different (n=x) for insert and merge sort to determine best N to use. (TJ to set up and test import)
- Calculate time complexity (analysis) of algos (Group)
- Plot empirical findings on on Python Notebook (Seaborne) (TJ)
    - method to return array of dict {size N, time(ms)}
- Find best X to change from merge sort to insert sort (TJ)
- Presenation slides (KIV -- if we using python notebook)
